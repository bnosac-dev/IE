The second model learns the word embeddings through bidirectional LSTM and use the output word vectors as input sequences to the CRF based model to predict the probability over the tag sequences and the weights on features.  This notebook focuses on the first model."

We use the index mapper (from word to index and tag to index) as we defined in `create_vocab.ipynb` and in the Step section above. To summarize, we use the most common $N$ words out of the total words that occured in all the datasets provided (`eng:train`, `eng:testa`, `eng:testb`). In our experiments $N$ is set $15,000$ which is half of the number of words that occured at least once in any of the given datasets. I added several extra words: PAD_WORD and UNK_WORD. PAD_WORDs are appended to sentences in a mini-batch to make every sentence of equal length (as to the length of the longest sentence in the mini-batch). UNK_WORD is used to map words that are not in our vocab (because we excluded 15,000 uncommon words). In addition, I assigned a PAD_TAG to indicate the padding words, and START_TAG and STOP_TAG. \n"
