# Part 1: Vanilla CRF
For the implementation of Conditional Random Field(CRF), I used the 
- features
- Point to the notebook for how different features affect the performance
- Add screenshot of the results

# Part 2: Bidirectional LSTM + CRF
- modification
- explain the architecture
- add a figure (draw and take a picture)
- learning rate?

- viterbi algorithm
- hyperparameters
